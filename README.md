# Application description

This is MERN stack application,

M - MongoDB - Database 
E - Express - Server side
R - React  - Front end
N - Node - Server side

It offers full capabilities through the above name architectures working in conjuction with eachother

The app is desinged as a sort of diary if you will, allowing the user to create and store memories on the fly, to cherish and view upon again at any time. There is a neat upload option available, allowing users to quickly save and store their pictures not only on their devices, but securely on a database also.

# Unique extras added 

1. GIF on app.js
2. Using history.push to redirect in .catch() blocks
3. Implemented an upload image option. This is handled by converting the image file to a base64 string, meaning it can be sent via http requests and rendered again client/server sides. I care not to admit how long this took me, but it works, hazza
4. Made another component to be used in catch() blocks, notifying the user that his/hers requests can not be fulfilled.
